Issues:

We have faced a few issues when working on this project.
One of these issues was that our datapath design was wrong, we had to redesign the datapath in order to work on it.
One of the other issues was that our memory didn't function as intended but we managed to fix it.
Another issue was being lost in the amount of wires our datapath have and having to figure out what we missed.
Another issue was the forwarding unit, it used to pass wrong wires so the result was wrong.
Another issue was the clock, it used to fetch every instruction every two cycles of the slow clock.

What works:

The whole program works as intended. Most of the issues we ran across were fixed.

What doesn't work:

There is no instruction that doesn't work.
